Key Principle:
---
```
  The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common
  divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by
  its difference with the smaller number.... Since this replacement reduces
  the larger of the two numbers, repeating this process gives successively
  smaller pairs of numbers until one of the two numbers reaches zero. When
  that occurs, the other number (the one that is not zero) is the GCD of
  the original two numbers
